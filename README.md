Log out and log back in for changes to apply.  

#### 2) Define applications details
In the `.env` file, enter your application details.   
```sh
# .env
EMAIL=myemail@myemail.com  # email to get alerts from Letsencrypt
DOMAIN=mysuperwebsite.com  # web domain for Nginx config and Letsencrypt
FLASK_ENV=development      # python application environment
```

#### 3) SSL certificates
We need to install the Letsencrypt client to get the SSL certicates.
```sh
sudo make install-le-client
```
It installs the Letsencrypt client and get a certificate for the specified web domain.

```sh
sudo make renew-le-cert
