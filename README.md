# docker-nginx-gunicorn-flask-letsencrypt

This repository contains necessary files to build a web-app running with Nginx / Gunicorn / Flask / LetsEncrypt using Docker and docker-compose.  

**Note: Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04**

## Docker

service | image
--- | ---
flask & gunicorn | `alpine:3.11.0`
nginx | `nginx:1.17.7-alpine`

## Requirements

dependency | commands
--- | ---
docker | [commands for Debian / Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/smallwat3r/45f50f067f248aa3c89eec832277f072)
docker-compose | [commands for Debian / Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/smallwat3r/bb4f986dae4cb2fac8f26c8557517dbd)
make | `sudo apt install make`
a domain or sub-domain | DNS A record needs to points to your server static IP

## Setting things up

#### 1) Clone this repo on your server

I recommend doing this in `/opt`  

```sh
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/smallwat3r/docker-nginx-gunicorn-flask-letsencrypt.git
```

Install docker, docker-compose and make (explained [above](#requirements)).  

If you want to run your own Flask app, replace the files in `./core/flask_app/` by your own (explained [above](#notes-if-you-want-to-run-it-with-you-own-flask-app)).  

#### 2) Add user to `docker` group  

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Log out from the server and log back in for changes to apply.  

#### 3) Define applications details
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and enter your application details.   
```sh
# .env.example

# email to get automatic alerts from Letsencrypt
EMAIL=myemail@myemail.com

# domain name or subdomain for Nginx config and Letsencrypt
DOMAIN=mysuperwebsite.com

# flask application environment
FLASK_ENV=development
```

## Turning it on

**Start application**
```sh
sudo make dc-start
```
<p style="text-align: center;">
 ðŸŽ‰ Your web-app should now be running online with HTTPS ðŸŽ‰   
</p>

**Other commands**
```sh
sudo make dc-reboot      # Reboot application.
sudo make dc-stop        # Stop application.
sudo make dc-cleanup     # Delete and clear docker images.
sudo make dc-start-local # Start application w/o nginx (for running locally)
```

Auto checks are running weekly to update the certificates.
